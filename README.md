Third Project of OpenClassrooms training 
<br>2022, July.

<h2> OBJECTIVES </h2>

Enhance a web page with CSS animations

<h2> CONTEXT </h2>

Ohmyfood! is startup that wants to develop a 100% mobile site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants.<br> 
The concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce their waiting time in restaurants because their menu is prepared in advance.

<h2> SKILLS </h2>

<ul>
<li>Cuting a web model</li>
<li>Styling the HTML elements with CSS</li>
<li>Using CSS animation to dynamize the website</li>
<li>Create a responsive website with Media Queries for desktops, tablets and mobile devices (mobile first)</li>
</ul>

<h2> ANIMATION LISTS </h2>
<h3>BUTTONS </h3>
<ul>
<li>On hover, the background color of the main buttons should slightly lighten. The shadow should also be more visible.</li>
<li>Upon clicking, the like should gradually fill. For this first version, the effect can be to appear on hover on desktop instead of click.</li>
</ul>
<h3>HOME PAGE </h3>
<ul>
<li>he loading spinner must appear 1 to 3 seconds upon arriving on the home page</li>
</ul>
<h3>MENU PAGE </h3>
<ul>
<li>Upon arriving on the page, the dishes must appear progressively with a slight time lag. They can either appear one by one, or by group "Starter", "Main course" and "Dessert".</li>
<li>The visitor can add the dishes they want to their order by clicking on them. This makes a small checkmark appear to the right of the dish. This checkmark must slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can appear on hover on desktop instead of click. If the title of the dish is too long, it must be trimmed with ellipsis. An example of the expected effect is provided.</li>
</ul>
